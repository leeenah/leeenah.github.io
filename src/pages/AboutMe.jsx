      <p>
        I come from an accounting and architecture background. Software
        development interests me because it's very similar to architecture -
        design and build functional things for people to use and experience.
        It's just achieved through a different medium.

        Given that there isn't a lot to do these days, in my spare time you will
        find me coding to build my knowledge and skills. I also enjoy
        filming/editing videos, cycling, and snowboarding.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am seeking opportunities to further develop my skills and I would love
        to work with you in your next project and bring it to life together -{" "}
